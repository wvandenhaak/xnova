# Welcome to XNova !
Hi! XNova is an Open Source project clone of the original space game, OGame.

This project is an old project, which is currently being updated and gradually rewritten. The main goal is to correct bugs, optimize the game and make it more reliable.

Game development is slow, as I do this in my spare time.

Feel free to contribute and comment :)
